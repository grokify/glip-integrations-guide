# Email Integrations

Every Glip team and direct conversation has the ability to receive posts via email. You can configure this email to receive notifications from apps.

To integrate via email, go to the conversation you're interested in and click the Settings gear icon and then click `Post via Email`

Now every email to this address will be posted to Glip. You can do this with your email system such as Microsoft Outlook or Google Apps. Apps such as [Tableau](apps/tableau.md) also have this capability.

If you used this with an app, please let us know by posting on our GitHub repo: [grokify/glip-integrations-guide](https://github.com/grokify/glip-integrations-guide) .
